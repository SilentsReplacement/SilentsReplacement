### Hi I'm SilentsReplacement. ðŸ‘‹

I'm a proficient game developer, who has hardcore experience in Luau and game development. I'm currently
working for [Frappe](https://www.roblox.com/groups/950346/Frapp#!/about) as the main scripter and 
as the lead developer of my own group, [PerduxStudios](https://www.roblox.com/groups/8876330/Perdux-Studios#!/about). I've contributed to many
open sourced libraries and utilities and also like teaching others useful knowledge and solving different problems many developers may have.
